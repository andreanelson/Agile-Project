        "description": "Brushing is a crucial part of grooming that's good for all cats and dogs. However, it's especially vital for long-haired breeds. Long-haired cats and dogs need the most brushing, as it can be more difficult for them to shed their excess fur naturally. Brushing the fur helps get rid of dandruff, dirt, and dead hair. And for cats, regular brushing decreases the number of hairballs your cat or kitten will cough up."

        "description": "While many people think of their hardwood floors and furniture when they think of their pet's nails, there are more benefits to regular clipping than that. Regular clipping can prevent your pet from injuring themselves by snagging nails on carpets or wooden slats. It also lets animals get better traction on the ground beneath them, helping them to stay balanced."
